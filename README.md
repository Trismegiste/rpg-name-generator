# RPG-Name-Generator
The RPG character name generator library is designed to create list of random names used for table-top role-playing games.

This library was extracted from the website [https://github.com/mark-tasaka/PHP-Character-Name-Generator PHP-Character-Name-Generator] 
from [https://github.com/mark-tasaka Mark Tasaka] with the help of [https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser nikic/PHP-Parser] 
(by the way, this tool is awesome)
