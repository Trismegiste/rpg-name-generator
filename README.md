# RPG-Name-Generator
The RPG character name generator library is designed to create list of random names used for table-top role-playing games.

This library was extracted from the website [PHP-Character-Name-Generator](https://github.com/mark-tasaka/PHP-Character-Name-Generator) 
from [Mark Tasaka](https://github.com/mark-tasaka) with the help of 
[nikic/PHP-Parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) 
(by the way, this tool is awesome)
